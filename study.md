## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
A callback lets you put in a function to be called later so it doesn't run right away?
Why would I want to do a callback? If code has to wait for input before running e.g. a 'click'?
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I think that the reasons to use a function expression is for a callback or when assigned to a variable?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel that when we are given a basic description of what we want the code to do that I can then read the code and break out what it is doing. I can even try to break the basic description into smaller bits (still workig on this).
However, I don't feel comfortable with knowing the names of what we are coding or how to take the requirements/smaller bits and write the code from scratch (not from memory but I'm still having a hard time with the layout since we are learning so many different things).
```
